# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using machine learning. The dataset includes age, gender, ticket class, and fare. We preprocess data by handling missing values, encoding categories, and selecting features. A classification model (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression) is trained to identify survival patterns.
