# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using machine learning. The dataset includes age, gender, ticket class, and fare. We preprocess data by handling missing values, encoding categories, and selecting features. A classification model (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression) is trained to identify survival patterns.

📌 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic Machine Learning problem that involves predicting which passengers survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

Key Steps in the Project:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✅ Feature Engineering (Handling Missing Values, Encoding Categorical Features)
✅ Model Selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy on Training & Validation Sets)
